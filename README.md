### Add Pins 
One of the first things you can do on the main page is add a pin on the map. There are already 3 pins on the map automatically added for you to view and test, they cannot be deleted (unless there is a bug) but they can be edited. Press anywhere on the map and you would be prompted to add a pin on that specific spot. Enter the name, rating (1-5), and review for the pin, you may opt out from entering the rating and review.

You may also utilize the search bar and add a pin to the specific location. This provides more accuracy. After entering the location, the map will zoom in on the location and it will have a blue pin, this blue pin does not mean a pin is added onto the map. Click on the blue pin to insert a pin close to it, similar to how you add a pin before.
