Once you signed up/logged in, you should be greeted with the main page. This page will be where all functionality is located. There are some short instructions on the right to guide you through what you can do.

### Add Pins 
One of the first things you can do on the main page is add a pin on the map. There are already 3 pins on the map automatically added for you to view and test, they cannot be deleted (unless there is a bug) but they can be edited. Press anywhere on the map and you would be prompted to add a pin on that specific spot. Enter the name, rating (1-5), and review for the pin, you may opt out from entering the rating and review. The pins added are also stored on the database and are tied to your account, so the pins will be retained after you logout of the website.

You may also utilize the search bar and add a pin to the specific location. This provides more accuracy. After entering the location, the map will zoom in on the location and it will have a blue pin, this blue pin does not mean a pin is added onto the map. Click on the blue pin to insert a pin close to it, similar to how you add a pin before.

### Edit/Delete Pins 
After adding the pins, if you click on them, you have the option to edit/delete them. You may have to hit cancel on the prompt as right now, everytime you click on the map, it registers as trying to add a pin. Once you hit cancel you should view the pin details and have the option to edit/delete the pin.

If you choose to edit the pin, you may change the name, rating, or review of the pin. Similarly as adding a pin, you can choose to omit the rating and review, but you have to input a name for the pin. Once the pin is updated, the site will automatically reload to render the new pin details on the screen. 


You also have the option of deleting the pin from the map. After choosing delete, there will be a confirmation prompt. If you confirm, it will be deleted from the map and the database, and the site will automatically reload to render the new information on the screen. If you delete a pin, if it is tied to an itinerary, it will disappear from the itinerary too.


### Add Itinerary and Add Pins to Itinerary
Before you can add a pin to an itinerary, you need to first make an itinerary. The itinerary section is located on the left of the site.  
First insert a name for the itinerary, then hit create itinerary. Once you have created the itinerary, you can start to add your pins to the itinerary.  
On your pins, you have the option of "Add to Itinerary". Once you click on the option, you need to enter the itinerary name. Once entered, it will appear on the itinerary pins list. The same location can only be used in one itinerary.

### Edit/Delete Itinerary  
There is an option to edit the itinerary name or delete the itinerary. As there is not an option to delete pins from the itinerary currently, deleting the itinerary is the only option if you want to redo the pins on the itinerary.  


### Small functionalities (Navigation, Logout)
On the top right of the site, there are some navigation buttons to help you to navigate the map more easily. There are zoom in/out buttons, and changing the direction of the map. There is also a logout button on the top center of the site, which users can utilize to logout from their account.

2. If you hit cancel when editing itinerary, it shows error message saying "Please enter a name for itinerary"
